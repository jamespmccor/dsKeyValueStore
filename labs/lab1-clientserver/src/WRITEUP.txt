Lab 1 Writeup

Name, NetID: Jevin Gu, jevin

Brief description of design:

- For part 1:
  - Basically just copied the format of PingApplication where you typecast
    a message into a specific message type with variables and then returned a
    result specified in the README
- For part 2:
  - Pretty much just copied the format of PingClient and PingServer since the
    lab 0 demo showed how to work with clients/servers/timers on an at-least-once
    messaging format. Used the hints from the README to setup the messaging and
    other boilerplate.
- For part 3:
  - Followed the guidance in class to keep track of a mapping of
    sender -> message number, result. Messages are numbered upwards on client
    side and are passed to the server along with the client address. The server
    keeps track of the highest message number for each client and will hold the
    current message number response in memory. It is only retransmitted when
    a request with the same number is received and discarded when a larger
    request comes in.
